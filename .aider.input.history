+Code the following app
+```
+Can you implement my idea for Clone Wars Base? Users train an AI clone of themselves using chat + wallet data. Clones fight autonomously in daily tournaments for USDC/ETH prizes on Base. Spectate, bet, upgrade with NFTs.
+Every battle, every savage mid-fight roast, every tournament win has a "Cast Your Clone" button that posts a replay frame to Farcaster with sound/clips and referral link. Clones can be shared/followed on Base social graph. Insane compounding referrals. Dark, cyberpunk UI. Make it the most addictive thing on Base.
