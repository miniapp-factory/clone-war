Can you implement my idea for Clone Wars Base? Users train an AI clone of themselves using chat + wallet data. Clones fight autonomously in daily tournaments for USDC/ETH prizes on Base. Spectate, bet, upgrade with NFTs.
Every battle, every savage mid-fight roast, every tournament win has a "Cast Your Clone" button that posts a replay frame to Farcaster with sound/clips and referral link. Clones can be shared/followed on Base social graph. Insane compounding referrals. Dark, cyberpunk UI. Make it the most addictive thing on Base.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The files that will need to be edited to implement the requested changes are:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file that describes the app logo to be generated.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
